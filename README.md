# SyncSpace

Enables groups members to access forums, create polls, create events that can be joined, and create a calendar.

## Description

Our solution to the challenge statement is to create a Club/Organization/Team Management web application called SyncSpace. This application will allow you to create groups and networks. Within these created groups and networks, members are able to access forums, create polls, and create events that can be joined. There will be a calendar feature that can be used to plan out network activities far in the future.
